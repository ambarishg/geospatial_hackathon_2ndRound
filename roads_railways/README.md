# Problem  
We need to find the roads which are accessible from the villages in India          

# Solution   
A Generic Notebook has been prepared which has   
**Inputs**        
* Roads of India        
* All villages of a particular state     
  
**Output** is the Roads overlayed on State Shape File        

We can use this framework for analysis of any state to 
determine the various types of roads available in the state         
* Motorways for the state              
* Villages the motorways are passing through       
   
Notebook is `roads_overlay_parameters.ipynb`    

The analysis is done in a seperate notebook `roads_analysis_parameters.ipynb`
